            <p>Basketball is a sport loved by millions around the world. It combines athleticism, strategy, and teamwork, making it a thrilling experience for both players and fans. From the professional leagues to the neighborhood courts, basketball brings people together, fostering a sense of community and competition.</p>
            <p>The history of basketball dates back to 1891, when Dr. James Naismith invented the game to keep his students active during the winter. Since then, it has evolved into a global phenomenon, with iconic players like Michael Jordan, LeBron James, and Kobe Bryant becoming household names.</p>
            <p>One of the most exciting aspects of basketball is the fast-paced nature of the game. With only 24 seconds to make a shot, teams must think quickly and work together seamlessly. The thrill of a buzzer-beater, the excitement of a slam dunk, and the strategic plays all contribute to the game's allure.</p>
            <p>Here is a table showcasing some of the most popular basketball teams and their achievements:</p>
